            <HText>What is a Hedge Fund?</HText>
            <p className="my-5 text-xl">
              A hedge fund is a fund that makes use of financial instruments
              allowing to generate high returns in any market situation. Most
              transactions are executed while hedging the transaction at a
              certain level, in order to minimize the inherent risk.
            </p>
            <p className="my-8 text-xl">
              In the current financial climate, which includes zero interest on
              savings and high managements fees, hedge funds are an alternative
              to mutual funds, investment houses, banks and they attract
              experienced investors searching attractive returns. Unlike mutual
              funds, which can only generate returns on a rising market (long),
              a hedge fund makes transactions in both directions (long and/or
              short) and therefore is able to generate returns when the market
              rises and when the market falls

          <HText2>The Fundâ€™s Structure</HText2>
          <div className=" mb-8 mx-0 flex-col flex md:flex-col">
            <p className="my-5  py-5 text-xl pr-8">
              The legal structure of a hedge fund is a limited partnership which
              is comprised of up to 50 investors. The investors in the fund are
              in fact the partners. The general partner in HETMED Fund is Rimon
              Hedge Funds Ltd., which is responsible for implementing the
              investment strategy. In most hedge funds, the partners pay the
              general partner management fees of about 2% and success fees of
              20%. The general partner in HETMED Fund is rewarded only by
              success fees based on real profits generated for all partners in
              the fund (the investors), which ensures that the interests of the
              fund manager and its investors are the identical.
